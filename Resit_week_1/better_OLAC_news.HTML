                    The OLAC system has now been integrated with the Linguistic Linked Open Data Cloud. Linked Data is "a recommended best
                    practice for exposing, sharing, and connecting pieces of data, information, and knowledge on the Semantic Web using URIs
                    and RDF." This opens the way for the contents of OLAC's 60 participating archives to be interlinked and queried.

                    the National Science Foundation, and hosted by the University of Pennsylvania Libraries, the service provides
                    powerful search over the combined catalog of all resources from all participating archives. It is based on the
                    "faceted search" strategy, in which search results are successively narrowed by clicking on available values of
                    standardized descriptors like language, language family, country, linguistic subfield, data type, format, and
                    more. Click on "Search Strategies" in the upper left panel for basic documentation:</td>

                    convened a Summit to present results of its initial test-bed phase and to pave the way for establishing an
                    operational confederation of digital repositories. DRIVER responds to the vision that all relevant scientific
                    content should be easily accessible through internet-based infrastructures. Like OLAC, DRIVER builds on the OAI
                    (Open Archives Initiative) infrastructure. OLAC was invited to present its work on developing a "thematic"
                    federation of repositories focused on language resources.
