    <h1>Here, I will do my best to explain, how does the <i>internet</i> work?</h1>

    <p>Sadly, I can only make use of minimal HTML elements, but I will utilise them to their <b>full</b> potential!</p>

    <p>In 1965, the first method of communicating between computers was found!</p>
<!-- added some identifiers for better changability -->
    <p class="info-paragraph">It was called "packet switching" , a method of data transmission where information is broken into small units called
        packets. Each packet travels independently across a network and may take different routes to reach the destination.
        Once all packets arrive, they are reassembled into the original message.</p>

    <p class="info-paragraph">TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) ensures reliable and ordered data transfer between devices. It starts with a
        handshake, breaks data into numbered packets, and ensures all arrive correctly by retransmitting lost ones. Once
        received, packets are reassembled in the right order, making TCP ideal for web browsing, emails, and file transfers
        where accuracy is key. </p>

    <p class="info-paragraph">Then, it went super fast! In 1988 the Internet relay-chat system was launched. It was a text-based communication
    system that allowed users to chat in real-time through public or private channels on a decentralized network of
    servers.<br>Then came HTTP, then the WWW, then in 1992, a very primitive version of this program came to live: The first version of HTML!</p>

    <p class="info-paragraph">On January 1<sup>th</sup>, 1983, the transition to TCP/IP made it possible for different networks to interconnect, marking the
        official birth of the modern internet. Just like H<sub>2</sub>O molecules form water, computers are connected by this shared
        protocol, enabling communication across the global network.</p>

    <h2>modern internet</h2>
    <p class="info-paragraph">But enough about the <em>history</em>, how does the internet work nowadays? <strong>Beware!</strong> a lot of things
        have changed since then! As the famous Tim Berners-Lee once said: </p>

        <blockquote cite="https://www.azquotes.com/author/8668-Tim_Berners_Lee">
 <p>"The Web does not just connect machines, it connects people."</p>
 </blockquote>
<!-- Some more divers HTML syntax, tables, acronyms etc -->
<p class="info-paragraph"><acronym title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</acronym> ensures web standards are followed globally. The W3C
    (World Wide Web Consortium) is responsible for developing and maintaining web standards that ensure the internet is
    interoperable, accessible, and functional across different platforms and devices.</p>   

    <p>The internet was once a <del>slow</del> <ins>fast</ins> and chaotic place, but with better protocols and
        technologies, itâ€™s now the <del>wild west</del> <ins>digital highway</ins> connecting billions of devices.</p>

        <h3>Better things the internet does nowadays:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Faster connection speeds</li>
            <li>Improved cybersecurity measures</li>
            <li>Better mobile accessibility</li>
            <li>Higher-quality video streaming</li>
            <li>More widespread 5G coverage</li>
          </ul>

<h3>How the Internet Works</h3>
<p class="info-paragraph">The internet is a global network of computers connected to each other, allowing them to share information. When you
    want to visit a website, your computer sends a request to a server using a set of protocols called TCP/IP. This
    request travels through various routers and networks, ensuring the data reaches its destination.</p>
<p class="info-paragraph">The server then processes the request and sends the website data (such as text, images, and videos) back to your
    computer. Your browser then interprets this data and displays the website on your screen. This entire process
    happens in just a few seconds!</p>
<p class="info-paragraph">Modern internet connections use high-speed networks, fiber optics, and wireless technologies to make sure the data
    can travel quickly and reliably. Without this complex infrastructure, we wouldn't be able to access websites, send
    emails, or stream videos.</p>
